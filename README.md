# monstera
Monstera is a browser extension that hides annoying stuff, such as:
- donation banners
- promoted Reddit posts
- (more coming soon)

It's designed to avoid conflicts with MiniGuinea, so the two can be used together to make a more peaceful browsing experience.

Monstera is still in extremely early development. Expect large changes.

I tried to make my commits signed, but it wouldn't work right. To prove that this message was not faked, look at commit 171ac8d and notice the verified status.
