# monstera
Monstera is a browser extension that hides annoying stuff, such as:
- donation banners
- promoted Reddit posts
- (more coming soon)

It's designed to avoid conflicts with MiniGuinea, so the two can be used together to make a more peaceful browsing experience.

Monstera is still in extremely early development. Expect large changes.
